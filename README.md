# NodeJS
Node.js is a server-side javascript runtime environment.

NodeJS present itself as two applications:
 - A script processor: node <file-name>
   When we run `node <file-name>, node initialize the event-loop, process the file, and then process the event loop ( For Asyncronous behaviour)
  
 - A REPL (Read Eval Print Loop)
